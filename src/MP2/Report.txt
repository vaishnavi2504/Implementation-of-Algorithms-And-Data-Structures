-----------------


Inference from the output:
1. Treemap consumes less memory compared to SkipLists. 
2. Add time for skip lists is much more than that for treemaps
3. Skip list performs extremely well in search operation O(log n). Clearly, skip list would be a better choice
   for search intense operations
