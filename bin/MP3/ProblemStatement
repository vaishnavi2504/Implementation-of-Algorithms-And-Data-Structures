 Project 3: Indexed heaps


Project Description
Implement the following:
(a) Indexed priority queues,
(b) Prim1 (priority queue of edges; using Java's priority queues),
(c) Prim2 (priority queue of vertices, using indexed heaps),
(d) Dijkstra'a algorithm for shortest paths using indexed heaps,
(e) [Optional]: Approximation algorithm for TSP (to be discussed in class).

Compare the performance of Prim1 and Prim2 on large, dense graphs (e.g., 1M nodes, 100M edges).
Excellence credit for part (e) will depend on the quality of the solution obtained in 30 sec.

Input and Output
An undirected graph is given as input, in the format expected by
readGraph method.  After the graph, two vertices, s and t are specified.
Do not modify the driver program given.  Write your own driver for (b) and (e).
Use the same input format for all parts.

Sample input (file "in"):
5 7
1 5 8
1 4 7
1 3 6
4 3 3
3 5 6
5 3 2
5 2 1
1 2
---------
Last line of input: s = 1, t = 2.
Prim's algorithm is run with source as s.
Dijkstra's algorithm is run with s as source and distance to t is printed.
A second optional parameter, given in the command line, controls which program
is called, and whether verbose output is printed.  

Output (if run as "java Driver in 0":
MST: 12
Distance: 9
Time: X msec.
Memory: X MB / XX MB.
